# LL-(1) Grammar Visualizer
*Interactive environment for step-by-step analysis of context-free grammars*

---

## Project summary
LL-(1) Grammar Visualizer is a web application that demonstrates the construction of the FIRST, FOLLOW and PREDICT sets and the derivation of the LL-(1) parsing table.  
The tool accepts grammars written in BNF or EBNF, visualises every iteration of the underlying algorithms and highlights conflicts that prevent the grammar from being LL-(1).  
The application was developed as part of a bachelor’s thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, TU Košice.

## Technology stack

| Layer | Selected technologies | Rationale |
|-------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Backend** | Spring Boot · Spring Web · MapStruct · Lombok · Springdoc-OpenAPI · JUnit 5 · Testcontainers | concise REST API, automatic mapping, containerised integration tests |
| **Algorithm module** | Custom Java implementation of FIRST, FOLLOW, PREDICT and LL-(1) table; EBNF→BNF transformer | transparent code that mirrors textbook pseudocode |
| **Frontend** | React · Material UI · better-react-mathjax · i18next | responsive UI, real-time MathJax rendering, English/Slovak localisation |
| **DevOps** | Maven · Docker · GitHub Actions · GitHub Pages · Railway | reproducible builds, free hosting (frontend on GH Pages, backend on Railway) |

## API overview

The server exposes two endpoints:

| Method & path | Purpose | Main parameters | Response |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| `POST /grammar/analyze` | Computes all sets and the LL-(1) table for the submitted grammar | request body: plain-text grammar | JSON containing the complete analysis and cached steps |
| `GET /grammar/step` | Returns a single pre-computed step to support lazy loading in the UI | `token` (analysis id), `index` (step number) | JSON with the highlighted pseudocode line and data changes |

The autogenerated OpenAPI specification is available at `/swagger-ui.html`.

## Key functionality

* interactive computation of FIRST, FOLLOW and PREDICT sets
* automatic construction and visual inspection of the LL-(1) parsing table
* parallel view of the original EBNF and its BNF transformation
* navigation through individual algorithm steps with keyboard shortcuts
* English/Slovak interface and optional dark theme

---

## Implementation notes

* **Performance** – Steps are cached on the server and fetched on demand; this limits memory consumption even for large grammars.
* **Math rendering** – MathJax typesetting is debounced and rendered off-screen before being shown, which reduces the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric by approximately 60 %.
* **Testing** – The core algorithm and the EBNF transformer are covered by unit and integration tests that achieve complete line coverage.

## Planned extensions

* visualisation of LR(1) and SLR parsing
* real-time collaborative “classroom” mode using WebSocket
* optional offline (PWA) distribution for lecture rooms without stable Internet connectivity
